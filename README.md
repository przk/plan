# plan
A very small browser app thingy, which shows notification of a class starting.

Should not exist, but does.

## Instructions
Download all files, edit `schedule.js` according to your schedule. Open plan.html in your web browser. Done.

The app should send a notification when a class starts, unless you set `Notify` property `false`.
